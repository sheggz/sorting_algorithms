# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O

## Description
---
The tasks in this directory aims to introduce me to the the different 
sorting algorithms and their respective time complexities. 

## Learning Objectives
---
At the end of this project, you are expected to know:
1. At least four different sorting algorithms
2. What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
3. How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
4. What is a stable sorting algorithm

## Tasks
---
* 0-bubble_sort.c, 0-O - a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending\
		 order using the Bubble sort algorithm
* 1-insertion_sort_list.c, 1-O - a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending\
 			order using the Insertion sort algorithm
* 2-selection_sort.c, 2-O - a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm

* 3-quick_sort.c, 3-O -  a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using\
			 the Quick sort algorithm
