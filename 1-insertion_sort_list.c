/**
 * insertion_sort_list - a function that sorts a doubly linked list using
 * insertion sort algorithm.
 * @list: holds the address of the list head
 *
 * Description:  we can assume (inductively) that the first nâ€“1 elements are
 * already sorted and insert element n in the right place. mongst the sorted
 * n-1 elements. This makes us start looping from node 1 (assuming node 0 is
 * sorted
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n^2) on worst case, o(n) on best case since the swap loop
 * never executes if elements are in the right position with respect to the
 * sorted n-1 elements before the node in focus
